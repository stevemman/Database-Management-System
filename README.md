# Database-Management-System
A C# application that connects to a database and allows the user to view, process, edit and update it's contents.
This project was created as part of my internship for the period July- August 2016 at Raycap.

# Version 1.0 is online!
The first version of the app is complete, all the basic functionality is present in this version. Future versions will include bugfixes GUI changes and occasionally some added features.
